# MCPueblo PortalCalc Configuration

# calculate = divide if the coordinate is in the overworld, multiply if in the nether.
# Default is 8 as vanilla portals have a ratio of 1:8,
# and shouldn't be changed unless you have a plugin/mod that is capable of changing this ratio.
# Must be a single digit, otherwise it will round to the nearest integer.
calculate-coord-by: 8

# Use <dimension> as placeholder on the first two messages for the dimension the portal location is to be calculated to.
# MineDown formatting is utilized for messages https://github.com/Phoenix616/MineDown
